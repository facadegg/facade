pyfacade
========

Welcome to the pyfacade documentation! pyfacade is a cross-platform library
to manipulate virtual devices created with `Facade <https://facade.gg>`_ system software.

Getting Started
---------------

.. note::

   pyfacade requires system software to be pre-installed on your system. Please download
   and install `Facade <https://facade.gg/download>`_ before continuing.

You can install pyfacade from pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyfacade

Now, you can stream pixels into a Facade virtual camera! The sample program below renders
a scrolling horizontal white line into the first Facade video device available.

.. literalinclude:: test_program.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

You can select the Facade camera in any video app (FaceTime, Zoom, Google Chrome, etc.) and
you should see the video output generated by your code:

.. image:: _static/scrolling-white-line.png
   :width: 400

.. toctree::
